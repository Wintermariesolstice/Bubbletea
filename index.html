    <p> Invented in the 1980s, bubble tea (also called "black pearl tea" or "boba tea") is a beloved Taiwan classic. 
        Though there are dozens of different variations, at its core it's a combination of tea, milk and the 'bubbles' -- which are essentially little balls made of anything from tapioca to fruit jelly.
